    <p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Members of Tesla’s board are scrambling to control a chief executive who some directors think is out of control.</p>
    <p
      class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Elon Musk, the electric-car maker’s co-founder and chief executive, stirred up a public storm by announcing on Twitter
      last week that he wanted to turn Tesla into <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/tesla-stock-elon-musk-private.html"
        title="">a private company</a>. In recent days, according to people familiar with the matter, some of his fellow board
      members delivered a stern message: Stop tweeting.</p>

      and in some cases making assertions of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-saudi-arabia.html"
        title="">dubious accuracy</a>. That has only added to the chaos engulfing the struggling company.</p>
    <p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Tesla’s board members are also racing to inoculate themselves from the possible fallout from Mr. Musk’s public statements.</p>
